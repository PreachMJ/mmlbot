Geekbot has no daemon support yet, you can either run it in `tmux` or `screen` if you want to run it in the background.


## 5. Installing modules

To install a module you only have to drop them into the `./Commands/modules` folder, Geekbot will automatically load it (requires restart of the bot)

#### Example Modules

We've created several example modules for you, you can find them in [this repository](https://github.com/runebaas/Geekbot-Modules). For easy updating we recommend cloning the repository directly into the modules folder.

To do this go into `./Commands/modules` and delete the `modules_be_here` file, then open a terminal inside the folder and run `git clone https://github.com/runebaas/Geekbot-Modules .`
